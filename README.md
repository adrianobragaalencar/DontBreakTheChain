An application that helps the user to stay on track with daily activities, keeping a record of each successive day an activity is completed. For example: (Running, walking your dog, studying Japanese, etc.) You can define a set number of days for an activity - such as staying away from coffee for 10 days. You can comment on and share your progress on Twitter as well as save your data to your DropBox account. In the case of theft or the loss of your mobile device, you will be able to easily recover your data. This application is based on the Jerry Seinfeld "Don't break the chain!" method:
